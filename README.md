----------------------------------------------------------
Author: Immanuel Maina

Description:
This C++ program converts a decimal number into binary format.
It splits the number into an integer part and a fractional part.
The integer part is converted to binary using a stack implemented with a linked list.
The fractional part is converted to binary using a queue implemented with a linked list.
